   - Place the downloaded files (`following.json` and `followers.json`) in the same directory as `compare.py`.

3. **Set Up Python:**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **Modify File Paths (if necessary):**
   - Open `compare.py` and ensure the paths to `following.json` and `followers.json` are correctly set according to their location.
